              <div class="summary">Multi Paxos is another Consensus algorithm thatâ€™s built on top of Paxos.
Basic Paxos talks about consensus on one data point. In vanilla Paxos, the proposer proposes a value and it gets accepted. But what if you want to propose a stream of values?
Continue from where we left in Paxos:
A proposerâ€™s proposal has been accepted. This proposer can propose another value to the acceptors on the same proposal/ballot number. It need not start another prepare phase. Eg: The first proposal ballot = 1, Log[0] = &#34;Insert X&#34; was accepted. Now, this node has become the leader. It can keep sending more accept messages on the same ballot number: ballot = 1, Log[0] = &#34;Insert Y&#34; ballot = 1, Log[2] = &#34;Insert Z&#34; </div>

              <div class="summary">Paxos is a simple Consensus algorithm. It was introduced by Leslie Lamport. Can read more here.
Paxos guarantees that there is consensus among multiple processes.
Setup: X nodes/processes Works in phases:
The proposer chooses a proposal number p with the given value v. It sends the message prepare(p,v) to a set of nodes &gt;= x/2 &#43; 1 (majority) At the acceptor end, there are two cases: Received prepare(p,v). Already accepted a proposal (x, y) where x&gt;p. Ignore the message (or send a negative reply). If already accepted proposal (x, y) where x&lt;p. Promise the proposer that I wonâ€™t accept any proposal with proposal number &lt; p. Send the values (x,y) as part of promise to the proposer. (if nothing was previously promised, then send p,v) At proposer end: If the majority of acceptors did not respond, then your proposal was rejected. Repeat with higher proposal number. If received promises from the majority of acceptors, then we need to set value to our proposal. Value for proposal = value of the highest proposal number received in the promise responses. Accept phase: Now send an accept message to all the acceptors with your proposal number and the value you decided in the previous step. If you receive acks from majority, then consensus is reached. Else, repeat. Note: Ballot number has to be unique across nodes. Else it breaks safety in Paxos. Maybe the nodes can memorize who sent what ballot as part of their promise and reject another node sending same ballot number.

              <div class="summary">Requirements of consensus:
Single proposed value is chosen Value chosen is proposed by the processes that are part of the system What do consensus algorithms do? What is the problem they solve? ðŸ”—Consensus means agreement. In a distributed system, multiple nodes agreeing on a state is facilitated by consensus algorithms. But itâ€™s not just one single value! Distributed systems keep getting a sequence of state change events that are constantly applied. All nodes will have to agree on the sequence of state changes as well. If Node A in a three node system of Nodes A, B, C receives a sequence of state changes X, Y, Z, then it needs to propagate this set of state changes to the remaining two nodes in the very same order. This is basically [[Log Replication]]! Consensus and replication is closely related! Reliable, consistent and correct/safe replication requires consensus!

Having seen a couple of my friends write blogs on WordPress and Blogger, these two blogging sites were the first to pop into my mind. However, for a simple use-case like mine, it seemed complicated and unnecessary. All I needed was a domain, a place to host my content, and an HTML generator to turn simple text into beautiful HTML.
