      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bigtable is a super fast, distributed storage system built to handle loads of structured data—think petabytes worth—while keeping things quick and responsive. It&amp;rsquo;s the engine behind many Google products you know and love, like Google Analytics and Google Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll break down the key points from the original Google Bigtable paper. If you&amp;rsquo;re up for some deeper reading, I&amp;rsquo;ve linked the full paper at the end—definitely worth a look!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to set up a vanity blog to showcase anything cool and awesome that I’ve worked on. Having seen a couple of my friends write blogs on WordPress and Blogger, these two blogging sites were the first to pop into my mind. However, for a simple use-case like mine, it seemed complicated and unnecessary. All I needed was a domain, a place to host my content, and an HTML generator to turn simple text into beautiful HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
