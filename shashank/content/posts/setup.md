I’ve always wanted to set up a vanity blog to showcase anything cool and awesome that I’ve worked on. Having seen a couple of my friends write blogs on WordPress and Blogger, these two blogging sites were the first to pop into my mind. However, for a simple use-case like mine, it seemed complicated and unnecessary. All I needed was a domain, a place to host my content, and an HTML generator to turn simple text into beautiful HTML.


I came across the combination of [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). This seemed like the perfect setup for me. However, I ran into some errors when installing Jekyll, and I did not have the patience to debug it. I started searching for an alternative and discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo is a static website generator written in Go. You can quickly build static websites such as this one, with your choice of [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I used the theme [mini](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/) to build this website. All you have to do is, install Hugo and write your content in Markdown format. Hugo takes care of the rest. You can check out the [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more details.
