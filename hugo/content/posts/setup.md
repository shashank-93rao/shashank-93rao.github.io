I've always wanted to setup a vanity blog to showcase anything cool and awesome that I've worked on. Having seen a couple of my friends write blogs on Wordpress and Blogger, these two blogging sites were the first to pop up in my mind. However, for a simple use-case like mine, it seemed complicated and un-necessary. All I wanted was a domain, a place where I can host my content and a content generator which would churn out simple text that I write into beautiful HTML. 

I came across the combination of [Github Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). This seemed like the perfect setup for me. However, I ran into some errors when installing Jekyll and I did not have the patience to debug it and started searching for an alternative and discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo is a static website generator written in Go. You can quickly build static websites such as this, with your choice of [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). I used the theme [tale](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/tale-hugo/) to build this website. All you have to do is, install hugo and write your content in *markdown* format. Hugo takes care of the rest. You can checkout the [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more details.
