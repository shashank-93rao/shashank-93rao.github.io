      <p>I’ve always wanted to set up a vanity blog to showcase anything cool and awesome that I’ve worked on. Having seen a couple of my friends write blogs on WordPress and Blogger, these two blogging sites were the first to pop into my mind. However, for a simple use-case like mine, it seemed complicated and unnecessary. All I needed was a domain, a place to host my content, and an HTML generator to turn simple text into beautiful HTML.</p>
<p>I came across the combination of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages and Jekyll</a>. This seemed like the perfect setup for me. However, I ran into some errors when installing Jekyll, and I did not have the patience to debug it. I started searching for an alternative and discovered <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>Hugo is a static website generator written in Go. You can quickly build static websites such as this one, with your choice of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theme</a>. I used the theme <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-cactus-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mini</a> to build this website. All you have to do is, install Hugo and write your content in Markdown format. Hugo takes care of the rest. You can check out the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick start guide</a> for more details.</p>
