      <description>&lt;p&gt;Requirements of consensus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single  proposed value is chosen&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Value chosen is proposed by the processes that are part of the system&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h5 id=&#34;what-do-consensus-algorithms-do-what-is-the-problem-they-solve&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do consensus algorithms do? What is the problem they solve?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#what-do-consensus-algorithms-do-what-is-the-problem-they-solve&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consensus means agreement. In a distributed system, multiple nodes agreeing on a state is facilitated by consensus algorithms. But it&amp;rsquo;s not just one single value! Distributed systems keep getting a sequence of state change events that are constantly applied. All nodes will have to agree on the sequence of state changes as well. If Node A in a three node system of Nodes A, B, C receives a sequence of state changes X, Y, Z, then it needs to propagate this set of state changes to the remaining two nodes in the very same order. This is basically [[Log Replication]]!&#xA;Consensus and replication is closely related! Reliable, consistent and correct/safe replication requires consensus!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
